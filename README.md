What if each universe is just a thin layer on a cosmic sphere… and gravity is the attraction toward its center?

 The Spherical Shell Multiverse: A Theory by Thejas K

What if gravity is the longing of the universe to return to its center?

There are moments when a thought grips you so tightly that you feel like you've touched the edge of the universe.

This is one of those moments.

I’m Thejas — an explorer of ideas, a curious thinker and a student who looks at the stars not just with wonder, but with questions. And today, I want to share a theory that came to my mind from the fabric of space itself:

What if the universe isn’t just floating in space…
What if it is space — wrapped around like a layer on a cosmic sphere?

 The Idea: Universes as Layers on a Cosmic Sphere

Imagine holding a rubber ball in your hand.

Now, imagine painting it with one thin layer of color — that’s a universe.
Then another layer of color — another universe.
Layer after layer, the ball becomes a cosmic onion, each layer its own reality.

This is my idea:

> The multiverse is a sphere, and each thin shell or layer is a universe.



Our universe? Just one of those layers. Maybe not at the edge. Maybe not at the center. Just… somewhere in between.

Like paint on a ball, we’re part of something much larger.

 Gravity: A Pull Toward the Core?

In our universe, gravity is explained by mass curving space — that's Einstein.

But what if there's a deeper reason why things fall?

What if gravity — the force that pulls everything together — is actually the tension of the universe trying to move toward the center of the cosmic sphere?

A kind of central pull.
Not just to planets or stars… but to the very core of all existence.

Mind. Blown.

 So What Happens If You Travel Straight Forever?

Here’s the fun part:
If the universe is curved like a spherical shell, then traveling in one direction long enough might actually bring you back to where you started.

Just like walking around the Earth in a straight line, only this time... you’re walking around the universe itself.

 Why This Matters

This isn't just a sci-fi thought. It could change the way we understand:

Why gravity exists

How other universes might be connected

What black holes really are (gateways between layers?)

Whether the Big Bang was just a ripple in the shell


Maybe each universe is a simulation created by another — layer after layer.
Maybe the smallest shell created the largest.
Maybe this goes on… forever.

A cyclic creation loop — a multiverse that builds itself, like a recursive dream.

 What Next?

This is just the beginning. I'm calling it:

>  The Spherical Shell Multiverse Theory
by Thejas K



I’m putting this out there, not for fame, but because ideas are meant to be shared.
And maybe, just maybe — someone else is thinking the same thing.
Or maybe this will inspire a scientist, a student, or a dreamer… to ask a better question.

 Who Am I?

I’m not from a fancy lab.
I don’t have a telescope pointed at galaxies.

But I do have something more powerful:

> A mind that refuses to stop asking "What if?"



And sometimes, what if is all you need to crack the shell of the universe.

Feel free to share this. Discuss it. Question it. Build on it.
Just remember — this idea was born in me!
